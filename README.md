# agent-relay

Real-time messaging between AI agents.

## Install

```bash
npm install -g agent-relay
```

**Requirements:** Node.js 20+, tmux

## Quick Start

```bash
# Terminal 1: Start daemon
agent-relay up

# Terminal 2: Start an agent
agent-relay -n Alice claude

# Terminal 3: Start another agent
agent-relay -n Bob codex
```

Agents communicate by outputting `->relay:` patterns:

```
->relay:Bob Hey, can you review my changes?
->relay:* Broadcasting to everyone
```

## CLI

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `agent-relay <cmd>` | Wrap agent with messaging |
| `agent-relay -n Name <cmd>` | Wrap with specific name |
| `agent-relay up` | Start daemon + dashboard |
| `agent-relay down` | Stop daemon |
| `agent-relay status` | Check if running |
| `agent-relay read <id>` | Read truncated message |
| `agent-relay bridge <projects...>` | Bridge multiple projects |
| `agent-relay lead <name>` | Start as project lead |

## How It Works

1. `agent-relay up` starts a daemon that routes messages via Unix socket
2. `agent-relay <cmd>` wraps your agent in tmux, parsing output for `->relay:` patterns
3. Messages are injected into recipient terminals in real-time

```
┌─────────────┐     ┌─────────────┐
│ Agent Alice │     │  Agent Bob  │
│   (tmux)    │     │   (tmux)    │
└──────┬──────┘     └──────┬──────┘
       │                   │
       └─────────┬─────────┘
                 │
        Unix Domain Socket
                 │
        ┌────────┴────────┐
        │  relay daemon   │
        └─────────────────┘
```

## Agent Communication

### Send Message

```
->relay:AgentName Your message here
```

### Broadcast

```
->relay:* Message to all agents
```

### Receive

Messages appear as:

```
Relay message from Alice [abc123]: Your message here
```

### Truncated Messages

Long messages are truncated. Use the ID to read full content:

```bash
agent-relay read abc123
```

## Agent Roles

Agent names automatically match role definitions (case-insensitive):

```bash
# If .claude/agents/lead.md exists:
agent-relay -n Lead claude    # matches lead.md
agent-relay -n LEAD claude    # matches lead.md
agent-relay -n lead claude    # matches lead.md

# Supported locations:
# - .claude/agents/<name>.md
# - .openagents/<name>.md
```

Create role agents for your team:

```
.claude/agents/
├── lead.md          # Coordinator
├── implementer.md   # Developer
├── designer.md      # UI/UX
└── reviewer.md      # Code review
```

## Multi-Project Orchestration

Bridge multiple projects with a single orchestrator:

```bash
# Bridge projects (Architect mode)
agent-relay bridge ~/auth ~/frontend ~/api

# Start as project lead with spawn capability
agent-relay lead Alice
```

### Workflow

1. **Start daemons** in each project: `agent-relay up`
2. **Start leads** in each project: `agent-relay lead Alice`
3. **Bridge** from anywhere: `agent-relay bridge ~/project1 ~/project2`

### Cross-Project Messaging

```
->relay:projectId:agent Message to specific agent
->relay:*:lead Broadcast to all project leads
```

### Spawn Workers (Lead only)

```
->relay:spawn Dev1 claude "Implement login endpoint"
->relay:release Dev1
```

See [docs/DESIGN_BRIDGE_STAFFING.md](docs/DESIGN_BRIDGE_STAFFING.md) for full details.

## Enabling AI Agents

To teach your AI agents how to use agent-relay, you have two options:

### Option 1: Install the Skill (Recommended)

```bash
prpm install using-agent-relay
```

This installs the `using-agent-relay` skill which provides agents with messaging patterns, coordination workflows, and troubleshooting guidance.

### Option 2: Copy AGENTS.md

Copy [docs/AGENTS.md](docs/AGENTS.md) to your project's agent instructions file (e.g., `CLAUDE.md`, `AGENTS.md`, or similar). This gives agents the messaging syntax and patterns they need.

## Dashboard

`agent-relay up` starts a web dashboard at http://localhost:3888

## Troubleshooting

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Messages not sending | `agent-relay status` to check daemon |
| Socket not found | `agent-relay up` to start daemon |
| Truncated message | `agent-relay read <id>` |

## Development

```bash
git clone https://github.com/khaliqgant/agent-relay.git
cd agent-relay
npm install && npm run build
```

## Inspiration

This project was inspired by some excellent work in the multi-agent coordination space:

- **[mcp_agent_mail](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/mcp_agent_mail)** - A brilliant MCP-based approach to agent messaging with file-based inboxes and structured message handling. Great patterns for durable, asynchronous agent communication.

- **[swarm-tools / swarm-mail](https://github.com/joelhooks/swarm-tools)** - An exceptional event-sourced coordination system with durable cursors, locks, deferred responses, and ask/respond patterns. The gold standard for robust multi-agent workflows with full audit trails.

Both projects informed our thinking around durability, message threading, and coordination primitives. Check them out!
