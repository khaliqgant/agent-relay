## Coordination Protocol

Agents communicate via `/tmp/agent-relay-dev/`:
- DocWriter, CodePolish, DevOps each have inbox directories
- Use `agent-relay inbox-*` commands

### Message Types
- `STATUS: <doing what>` - Progress update
- `QUESTION: <question>` - Need input from another agent
- `DONE: <task>` - Task completed
- `BLOCKER: <issue>` - Blocked on something
- `HANDOFF: <what>` - Passing work to another agent

### Coordination Rules
1. Before editing a file, announce: `STATUS: Editing <filename>`
2. After completing a task, broadcast: `DONE: <task description>`
3. If blocked, ask: `QUESTION: @AgentName <question>`
4. Check inbox after each major task

## Success Criteria
- [ ] npm install agent-relay works
- [ ] All CLI commands have --help
- [ ] README has working quick start
- [ ] 3+ working examples
- [ ] Test coverage > 80%
- [ ] No TypeScript errors in strict mode
