      "decision": "Use trajectories for learnings instead of separate learning repository",

      "decision": "Self-scheduling is the key missing feature for 24/7 autonomy",

    "Tmux-Orchestrator pioneered 24/7 autonomous agent operation using tmux persistence + self-scheduling",
    "Real-time messaging replaces scheduling - agents can wake each other instantly instead of scheduling delayed self-messages",
    "Our continuity system (ledger + handoff injection on spawn) covers their context notes pattern",
    "Fixed 3-tier hierarchy (Orchestrator→PM→Engineer) solves context window limits but is less flexible than relay's any-topology approach",
    "Shell script + timing delays (~500ms) is simpler but 100x slower than our Unix socket (<5ms)",
    "Self-scheduling with context notes is the killer feature for autonomous operation",
