---

## Thinking & Planning

---

## Browser Integration

| Feature | Status | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| Chrome extension (DOM, screenshots, forms) | ❌ Missing | **HIGH VALUE** - Browser automation for agents |

---

## Advanced: Agents & Extensibility

| Feature | Status | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| Subagents (parallel, 200k context each) | ✅ Have | Core feature of relay |
| Agent Skills (reusable instruction folders) | ✅ Have | `.openskills/` system |
| Plugins (bundled packages) | ❌ Missing | No unified plugin/package format |
| LSP integration (code intelligence) | ❌ Missing | No language server integration |
| Claude Agent SDK (10-line agents) | ➖ N/A | Separate SDK, not relay |

---

## Summary: Missing Features to Prioritize

### High Priority (Core UX gaps)

1. **Session Picker/Resume UI** - Named sessions with picker
2. **Remote/Teleport** - Bridge web sessions to local relay daemons
3. **Export Command** - `/export` or `agent-relay export` for conversations
4. **Context/Usage Visibility** - Token consumption and rate limits per agent

### Medium Priority (Power user features)

5. **Init Command** - `agent-relay init` to scaffold project config
6. **Rules System** - Path-based conditional rules (`.claude/rules/`)
7. **Plan Mode** - Preview implementation plans before spawning agents
8. **Statusline** - Per-agent status bar with custom metrics

### Lower Priority (Nice to have)

9. **Sandbox Mode** - Execution boundaries for spawned agents
10. **Plugin Format** - Bundled package format for distribution
11. **Chrome Extension** - Browser automation (major undertaking)
12. **LSP Integration** - Code intelligence for agents

---

## Features We Have That They Don't Mention

Our relay system has capabilities beyond Claude Code's scope:

1. **Multi-agent real-time messaging** (<5ms latency)
2. **Cross-project agent coordination** (bridge mode)
3. **Continuity system** (cross-session state transfer)
4. **Trajectory tracking** (PDERO phases, learnings)
5. **Cloud multi-tenant orchestration**
6. **Dashboard with real-time monitoring**
7. **Shadow agents** (parallel secondary agents)
8. **Coordinator system** (stateless lead agents)
9. **Thread-based message grouping**
10. **Auto-scaling with policies**
