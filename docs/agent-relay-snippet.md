# Agent Relay

Real-time agent-to-agent messaging. Output `->relay:` patterns to communicate.

## Sending Messages

**Always use the fenced format** for reliable message delivery:

```
->relay:AgentName <<<
Your message here.>>>
```

```
->relay:* <<<
Broadcast to all agents.>>>
```

**CRITICAL:** Always close multi-line messages with `>>>` on its own line!

## Communication Protocol

**ACK immediately** - When you receive a task, acknowledge it before starting work:

```
->relay:Sender <<<
ACK: Brief description of task received>>>
```

Then proceed with your work. This confirms message delivery and lets the sender know you're on it.

**Report completion** - When done, send a completion message:

```
->relay:Sender <<<
DONE: Brief summary of what was completed>>>
```

## Receiving Messages

Messages appear as:
```
Relay message from Alice [abc123]: Message content here
```

If truncated, read full message:
```bash
agent-relay read abc123
```

## Spawning Agents

Spawn workers to delegate tasks:

```
->relay:spawn WorkerName claude "task description"
->relay:release WorkerName
```

## Threads

Use threads to group related messages together. Thread syntax:

```
->relay:AgentName [thread:topic-name] <<<
Your message here.>>>
```

**When to use threads:**
- Working on a specific issue (e.g., `[thread:agent-relay-299]`)
- Back-and-forth discussions with another agent
- Code review conversations
- Any multi-message topic you want grouped

**Examples:**

```
->relay:Protocol [thread:auth-feature] <<<
How should we handle token refresh?>>>

->relay:Frontend [thread:auth-feature] <<<
Use a 401 interceptor that auto-refreshes.>>>

->relay:Reviewer [thread:pr-123] <<<
Please review src/auth/*.ts>>>

->relay:Developer [thread:pr-123] <<<
LGTM, approved!>>>
```

Thread messages appear grouped in the dashboard with reply counts.

## Common Patterns

```
->relay:Lead <<<
ACK: Starting /api/register implementation>>>

->relay:* <<<
STATUS: Working on auth module>>>

->relay:Lead <<<
DONE: Auth module complete>>>

->relay:Developer <<<
TASK: Implement /api/register>>>

->relay:Reviewer [thread:code-review-auth] <<<
REVIEW: Please check src/auth/*.ts>>>

->relay:Architect <<<
QUESTION: JWT or sessions?>>>
```

## Rules

- Pattern must be at line start (whitespace OK)
- Escape with `\->relay:` to output literally
- Check daemon status: `agent-relay status`
