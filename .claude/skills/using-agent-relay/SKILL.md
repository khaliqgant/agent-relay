# Using agent-relay

## Overview

Real-time agent-to-agent messaging. Two modes: **tmux wrapper** (real-time, sub-5ms) and **file-based team** (async, simpler).

## When to Use

- Multiple agents coordinating on shared codebase
- Turn-based interactions (games, reviews, task handoff)
- Parallel task distribution
- Real-time Claude/Codex/Gemini collaboration

**Don't use:** Single agent, cross-host networking, guaranteed delivery required.

## Quick Reference

| Pattern | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `->relay:Name message` | Direct message (output as text) |
| `->relay:* message` | Broadcast to all |
| `[[RELAY]]{"to":"Name","body":"msg"}[[/RELAY]]` | Structured JSON |
| `\->relay:` | Escape (literal output) |
| `relay read <id>` | Read truncated message |

## CLI Commands

```bash
relay -f                    # Start daemon + dashboard
relay --status              # Check daemon
relay --stop                # Stop daemon
relay wrap -n Alice claude  # Wrap agent with messaging
relay read abc123           # Read truncated message
```

### Team Commands (file-based)

```bash
relay team send -n You -t Recipient -m "Message"
relay team send -n You -t "*" -m "Broadcast"
relay team check -n You --no-wait     # Non-blocking
relay team check -n You --clear       # Clear after read
relay team status                     # Show team
```

## Sending Messages (Tmux Mode)

**Output the pattern directly** - don't use bash commands:

```
->relay:BlueLake I've finished the API refactor.
->relay:* STATUS: Starting auth module.
```

Pattern must be at line start (whitespace/prefixes OK):

```
->relay:Name message          # Works
  ->relay:Name message        # Works
- ->relay:Name message        # Works
Some text ->relay:Name msg    # Won't work
```

## Receiving Messages

Messages appear as:
```
Relay message from Alice [abc123]: Message here
```

### Truncated Messages

Long messages show `[TRUNCATED...]`. Read full content:
```bash
relay read abc123
```

**Rule:** If message ends abruptly, always read full message before responding.

## Coordination Patterns

```
# Task assignment
->relay:Developer TASK: Implement /api/register

# Status broadcast
->relay:* STATUS: Starting auth module
->relay:* DONE: Auth complete

# Review request
->relay:Reviewer REVIEW: src/auth/*.ts

# Question
->relay:Architect QUESTION: JWT or sessions?

# Blocked
->relay:* BLOCKED: Need DB credentials
```

## Multi-Project Bridge

```bash
# Bridge multiple projects
relay bridge ~/auth ~/frontend ~/api

# Cross-project messaging
@relay:projectId:agent Message
@relay:*:lead Broadcast to leads

# Spawn workers (lead mode)
relay lead Alice
@relay:spawn Dev1 claude "Implement login"
```

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| Using bash to send real-time messages | Output `->relay:` directly as text |
| Messages not sending | `relay --status` to check daemon |
| Incomplete message content | `relay read <id>` for full text |
| Pattern not at line start | Move `->relay:` to beginning |
| Forgetting to clear inbox | Use `--clear` flag |

## Troubleshooting

```bash
relay --status                    # Check daemon
relay --stop && relay -f          # Restart
ls -la /tmp/agent-relay.sock      # Verify socket
```
